                    Viktor is the Creative Director of Gild Studios, which he
                    founded to realise wonderful and captivating creations for
                    the ad industry. He is a retoucher and 3d artist by trade,
                    and an English philologist by education. Though, the latter
                    has no bearing on his life except sometimes going "uhm,
                    actually" when something vaguely related to linguistics
                    comes up.

                    conferences, including CreativeLive, KelbyOne, or Visual
                    Education as he believes sharing is vital for the
                    advancement of this craft. His most useful tools can be
                    found on his Gumroad and his free videos on YouTube. In 2019
                    he was named as one of Forbes' 30 under 30. He is not under
                    thirty anymore.

                    Some things he likes, including but not limited to, and in

                    the games industry, mountains, challenges, and diving into
