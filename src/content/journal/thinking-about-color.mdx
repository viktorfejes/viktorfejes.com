Color is a powerful force in the world of digital art. It evokes emotion, sets the mood, and can make or break the overall impact of your work. As a digital artist, mastering color theory and employing color strategically are essential aspects of your success.  Let's dive into some key considerations when thinking about color within your digital creations.

- **The Color Wheel: Your Best Friend** Understanding the color wheel is foundational to using color intentionally. This classic tool shows how colors relate to each other. Here are a few helpful terms to keep in mind:
  - Primary colors: Red, yellow, and blue
  - Secondary colors: Created by mixing two primary colors (orange, green, and purple)
  - Tertiary colors: Formed by mixing a primary and secondary color.

- **Color schemes** provide frameworks for choosing pleasing combinations:
  - Complementary: Colors directly opposite each other on the color wheel, offering high contrast (ex: red and green).
  - Analogous: Colors adjacent to each other on the color wheel, creating harmony (ex: yellow, yellow-orange, orange).
  - Triadic: Three colors evenly spaced around the color wheel, leading to vibrancy (ex: red, yellow, blue).
- Colors subconsciously influence our feelings. Think about these common associations:
  - Red: Passion, energy, excitement
  - Blue: Calmness, trust, stability
  - Yellow: Happiness, optimism, creativity
  - Green: Nature, growth, balance
- Most digital art software offers robust color tools. Experiment with:
  - Color pickers
  - Hue, saturation, and brightness sliders
  - Color palettes

## Code Block Example
Here's a simple CSS example demonstrating color use in web design:

```css
body {
  background-color: #E8F0FE; /* A light blue */
}

h1 {
  color: #3D3D3D;  /* A dark gray */
}

button {
  background-color: #007BFF; /* A standard blue */
  color: white;  
}
```
