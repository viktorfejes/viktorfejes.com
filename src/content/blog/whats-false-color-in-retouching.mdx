In science, false color is a color rendering method for data visualization where the object is not shown in its true colors -- the way we would normally see them -- but using a different color rendering method depicting one or more aspects of the data. Think of a thermal imaging camera, an elevation map, or an MRI scan.

Used in cinematography, and consequently, photography, the term usually refers to a feature on monitors and cameras for visualizing exposure in the form of IRE levels, colored using a specific color palette. It is especially useful when a scene's exposure level is difficult to dial in or consistency is paramount.

However, just like in science, we are not limited to only using exposure visualizations, we could visualize any aspect of an image to take advantage of this powerful method.

## The sky is the limit
As retouching still images requires us to care about the minutia, it helps if we can concentrate on a single aspect of an image at a time. This is where false colour comes in -- we are able to visualize any aspect of an image from exposure levels through colour density to hue variations. The sky is the limit.
