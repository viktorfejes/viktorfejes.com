Vector operations are fundamental in various fields including computer graphics, physics, and image processing. There are many
posts about what they are and how they work but I want use this post to try to build intuition about how they work using
interactive visuals.

In this post we are going to explore vector operations and what they look like in (mostly) 2D space.

In this post, we'll use:
- **Point** - a specific location in 2D space, like a vertex in a mesh or a pixel coordinate.
- **Vector** - a direction and distance; and arrow that can be moved around freely representing offset between points.

The first operation we are taking a look at is addition, just because this is what came to my mind first when I was
building the web component for it. So, this is just a second paragraph I'm using to test my styling with.

## Vector addition

quite a few extra fancy stuff.

```c
struct vec2 {
    float x;
    float y;
};
```
