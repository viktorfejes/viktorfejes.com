Plenty has been written about vector operations — and most of it is correct. However, reading alone rarely makes things
click. In my experience, nothing beats applying something hands-on. And if that's not possible, building a visual
intuition is the next best thing. That's what this post is about: understanding vector operations through interactive
visuals.

Now, there are many kinds of vectors out there. In computer graphics, for instance, we often use the same data structure for
both **points** and **vectors** — even though they represent different ideas.

For clarity, when I say **vector** in this post, I always mean a *direction and distance*, represented by an arrow. On the other hand,
**point** refers to a *location in space.*

In this post we'll be looking at the following operations — each with an interactive visual, a bit of math, and some code to tie it all
together:
- [addition](#vector-addition),
- [subtraction](#vector-subtraction),
- [scaling](#vector-scaling),
- [magnitude/length](#vector-length),
- [dot product](#vector-dot-product),
- [cross product](#vector-cross-product),
- and [reflection](#vector-reflection).

If you're only here for the visuals, feel free to skip the code! However, for those interested, I'll be using the following C
struct throughout to represent 2D vectors:

```c
typedef struct vec2 {
    float x;
    float y;
} vec2_t;
```

## Vector addition

When you add two vectors, you're essentially stacking movements one after the other.

This is similar to walking through a city: first, you walk 3 blocks east, then you turn and go 4 block north. However, instead
of tracking each leg of your walk, you could draw a single arrow from your starting point to your final destination. That
arrow is the **sum** of your two vectors — a single direction and distance that gets you to the same place.

This kind of "chained movement" comes up constantly in graphics and physics. Forces can be added together this way. UV coordinates can be
offset by directional gradients in image filters. It's all just vector addition

<div class="mb-4"><VectorAdd /></div>

<div class="mb-4">
    <Alert type="info">Vector addition is <strong>commutative</strong>, meaning the order of operations doesn't matter: $$\vec{A} + \vec{B} = \vec{B} + \vec{A}$$</Alert>
</div>

You can see this in the visualization, too. Whether we add A to B or B to A (stacking them tail to head), the resulting vector
ends up the same.

Mathematically, all we are doing is adding each vector component individually to the corresponding component in the other vector.

<p class="text-center">$$\vec{A} + \vec{B} = \begin{bmatrix} A_x + B_x \\ A_y + B_y \end{bmatrix}$$</p>

Which can be expressed the following way in code:

```c
vec2_t vec2_add(vec2_t a, vec2_t b) {
    return (vec2_t){
        .x = a.x + b.x,
        .y = a.y + b.y
    };
}
```

## Vector subtraction

Vector subtraction is about finding the directional difference between two vectors. In other words, how to get from one to the
other.

A helpful way to think about this is to treat vectors as positions — like points in space. Given vector A and B, **subtracting
A from B gives you the direction and distance** you'd need to travel to get **from point A to point B.** You're not stacking movements
this time, you are comparing them.

This comes up constantly in graphics, when computing motion vectors, trying to find the light direction from the light position,
or in image processing for edge detection and normal map generation.

<div class="mb-4">
    <Alert type="warning">Important to note that vector subtraction is <strong>not commutative</strong>: <span class="text-nowrap">$$\vec{A} - \vec{B} \ne \vec{B} - \vec{A}$$</span></Alert>
</div>

<div class="mb-4"><VectorSub /></div>

In the visualization, the **B - A vector** is shown both as a vector pointing from the head of A to the head of B, and as one
starting from the center of the coordinate system. That's because the result is still just a direction and a length and it's
common to draw vectors from the origin to better compare their properties.

Similarly to addition, subtraction is also applied component-wise:
<p class="text-center">$$\vec{A} - \vec{B} = \begin{bmatrix} A_x - B_x \\ A_y - B_y \end{bmatrix}$$</p>

Which in code is as simple as:

```c
vec2_t vec2_sub(vec2_t a, vec2_t b) {
    return (vec2_t){
        .x = a.x - b.x,
        .y = a.y - b.y
    };
}
```

## Vector scaling

Scaling a vector — that is, multiplying by a scalar —, stretches or compresses it on its own axis. If the scalar is **positive**,
only its length changes. However, when the scalar is **negative**, its length changes and also flips its direction.

<div class="mb-4"><VectorScale /></div>

This is a simple but powerful operation. You'll often scale direction vectors to control speed or magnitude, such as adjusting
velocity, resizing normals, or scaling gradients in image effects.

Mathematically, we multiply each component of the vector by the scalar:
<p class="text-center">$$\text{scale}(\vec{A}, s) = s \cdot \vec{A} = \begin{bmatrix} s \cdot A_x \\ s \cdot A_y \end{bmatrix}$$</p>

In code, this looks like:

```c
vec2_t vec2_scale(vec2_t a, float scale) {
    return (vec2_t){
        .x = a.x * scale,
        .y = a.y * scale
    };
}
```

## Vector magnitude

Even though vectors represent both direction and magnitude, their components don’t explicitly store the magnitude. But we can
compute it easily by treating the vector as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.

If you imagine the vector's x and y components as the triangle's legs, then by the **Pythagorean theorem**, the length of the
vector (its magnitude) is:
<p class="text-center">$$|\vec{A}| = \sqrt{A_x^2 + A_y^2}$$</p>

<div class="mb-4"><VectorMag /></div>

This value is often used to normalize vectors (make them unit length), calculate distances, or compare sizes of directional
quantities.

In code, we simply do the following:

```c
float vec2_mag(vec2_t vec) {
    return sqrtf(vec.x * vec.x + vec.y * vec.y);
}
```

## Vector dot product

As you can see, we have covered the most common operations already and we have addition and subtraction but we don't have
multiplication, yet. The reason is that vector multiplication is not as straightforward as multiplying real numbers — they are
defined in more than one ways.

One of which is called the **dot product**, and it calculates the angle between two vectors. In other words, how much two
vectors are pointing in the same direction. The result is not a vector, though, but a scalar. We are usually interested in
three of its states:
- if **both vectors point in** exactly **the same direction**, the dot product is large and **positive,**
- if they're at **90°**, the dot product is **zero,**
- if **they point in opposite directions**, the result is **negative.**

This makes the dot product perfect for things like determining if an object is facing the camera, checking if a player is within
a cone of vision, or computing brightness in lighting, as Lambert's cosine law uses a dot product between the surface normal
and the light direction.

<div class="mb-4"><VectorDot /></div>

<div class="mb-4">
    <Alert type="info">If the two vectors are normalized (magnitude == 1), the dot product equals the <strong>cosine of the angle</strong> between them.</Alert>
</div>

Another way to think of the dot product is as a projection. It tells us how much of vector B lies in the direction of vector A.
If you imagine drawing a perpendicular line from B onto A, the dot product is proportional to the length of that "shadow", as
can be seen in the visualization.

Therefore, one way to calculate the resulting dot product is:
<p class="text-center">$$\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = A_x \cdot B_x + A_y \cdot B_y$$</p>

```c
float vec2_dot(vec2_t a, vec2_t b) {
    return a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y;
}
```

## Vector cross product

Another way to define the multiplication of two vectors is the vector cross product. In 3D, the cross product gives a new
vector perpendicular to both inputs. But in 2D, there’s no “out of plane” direction — so we instead use a scalar cross product
that tells us the signed area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors.

More intuitively, it tells us which direction you'd have to turn to rotate from vector A to B:
- Positive - turn left (counter-clockwise)
- Negative - turn right (clockwise)
- Zero - perfectly aligned

<div class="mb-4">
    <Alert type="warning">The above interpretation of "which way to turn" depends on the *handedness* of the coordinate system we are working in. In mathematics that is right-handed.</Alert>
</div>

<div class="mb-4"><VectorCross /></div>

The cross product is incredibly useful for steering behaviors (e.g. deciding which way to turn), for backface culling, and for
computing triangle winding and area.

It is non-commutative and component-wise is calculated using the following formula:
<p class="text-center">$$\vec{A} \times \vec{B} = A_x \cdot B_y - A_y \cdot B_x$$</p>

Which can be translated to code the following way:
```c
float vec2_cross(vec2_t a, vec2_t b) {
    return a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x;
}
```

## Vector reflection

Reflecting a vector across a surface (like a mirror, or a normal) is crucial in physics and rendering. You'll see this used in:
- light ray reflection in ray tracing,
- bouncing projectiles (e.g. pool, bullets, ricochets),
- image effects like screen-space reflections.

<div class="mb-4">
    <Alert type="warning">It is important to make sure the normal is <strong>normalized</strong> (unit length) or the result will be incorrect!</Alert>
</div>

<div class="mb-4"><VectorReflect /></div>

To reflect a vector across a **unit** normal, we subtract twice the projection of the vector onto the normal:
<p class="text-center">$$\vec{R} = \vec{V} - 2(\vec{V} \cdot \vec{N})\vec{N}$$</p>

```c
vec2_t vec2_reflect(vec2_t v, vec2_t n) {
    float dot = vec2_dot(v, n);
    return (vec2_t){
        .x = v.x - 2.0f * dot * n.x,
        .y = v.y - 2.0f * dot * n.y
    };
}
```

## Wrapping it up

While vector math might seem abstract at first, it forms the foundation of everything from basic motion to complex lighting
and physics in games and graphics programming. Understanding how to add, scale, reflect, or take the dot and cross product of
vectors isn’t just about numbers. It’s about being able to reason clearly about space, direction, and interaction.

Hopefully, the visuals and examples here made these concepts click a little more intuitively. As with most things in math and
code, the more you play with vectors — tweak them, visualize them, apply them — the more second nature they’ll become. And once
that happens, you’ll start seeing them everywhere.
