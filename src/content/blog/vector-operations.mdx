This is a blog post about vector operations to visually build intuition about how they work and how to think of them.
This is completely work in progress and even these words are gibberish just because I'm testing something. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

The first operation we are taking a look at is addition, just because this is what came to my mind first when I was
building the web component for it. So, this is just a second paragraph I'm using to test my styling with.

quite a few extra fancy stuff.
