description: In collaboration with Safe In Harm's Way, DomesticShelters.org, and Neon agency, I crafted and retouched still and motion assets for a PSA campaign to raise awareness of domestic violence. I was responsible for creating an eerie environment in CGI, integrating talent into the scene, color grading, and retouching the final images.

We went through several iterations for the design of the house, until we landed on a look that was both eerie and realistic. The darkened windows of the house in contrast with the warm daylight and meticulously kept lawn were meant to create a sense of unease and tension.

Photographer, John Keatley, shot the talent in a studio, and I was responsible for integrating them into the scene.

## The Monster Hand
The base model of the monster hand was created by the talented Ana Carolina Pereira. I took the model and sculpted some additional details inside ZBrush, then textured it in Substance Painter. Final rendering was done in 3Ds Max with V-Ray, before integrating it into the scene.

Since the hand was visible only in a small portion of the final image, it was important to make sure that the details, and it being a inhuman hand, were visible and clear.

## Campaign Success
A small video was also created for LED billboards and social media. The campaign was featured on over 2,900 national screens in high-traffic areas like Times Squareâ€™s entrance in New York City, Union Station in D.C, Bayside Marketplace in Miami, 110 freeway entrance in LA, and general office lobbies and elevators, gas stations, billboards, digital bulletins, and mall kiosks throughout the country.
