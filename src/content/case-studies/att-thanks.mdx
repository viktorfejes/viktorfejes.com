description: I retouched and helped with the overall direction for the AT&T Thanks campaign. The project called for a range of creative skills, from designing an appealing and fitting color palette, to compositing and retouching the final images. The result was a series of images that were used in various marketing materials, including billboards, social media, and in-store displays.

As the scope of the project was huge, and I was the only person responsible for the whole campaign, I had to be organized and efficient. It helped that the photographs provided by photographer John Keatley were of exceptional quality but because of the scale of the project, I had to be very careful with the color palette and the overall look of the images. I had to make sure that they were consistent and that they all fit together as part of the same campaign.
