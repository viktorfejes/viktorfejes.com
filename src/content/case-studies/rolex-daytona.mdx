        For the hero image I wanted to make sure the lighting style would fit with the brand's aesthetic. I used numerous area lights to create sharp reflections around the bezel in a familiar pattern that is often seen in Rolex's marketing material. The watch was modeled in 3Ds Max and textured in Substance Painter. The final render was done in Corona Renderer.
