<div class="w-full max-w-xl mb-8">
    <p class="max-w-xl text-lg mb-8">A collection of CG portraits I created utilising various techniques and software, including Maya, Substance Painter, ZBrush, and more. My aim is generally to achieve close to photorealism without taking too long on execution.</p>
