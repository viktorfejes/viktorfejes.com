description: A desktop app for real-time visualization of image values across multiple scopes

    <p class="max-w-xl text-lg mb-8">Chroma Scopes is a standalone real-time image analysis application that provides high-performance
    color scopes for any visual software. Currently, being developed using C and DirectX 11</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">Working as a professional retoucher, I was frustrated that Photoshop — the current industry
        standard — offers only a histogram for color evaluation, while motion tools like DaVinci Resolve include full
        vectorscopes, waveforms, RGB parades, and more. Chroma Scopes is my response to that: a fast, standalone app
        for real-time image analysis that can work with any visual software.</p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-medium my-4 dark:text-neutral-300">Early prototypes</h2>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">The project began as a plugin using Photoshop's new UXP system but its limited API and performance bottlenecks forced me to get creative. I moved from an in-app canvas
        to an external WebGL view, then to an Electron app for a more native feel. The communication between the external
        tools and Photoshop was done through Websockets which proved more performant than I had anticipated.</p>
        
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">Eventually, to get access to compute shaders and better performance I rebuilt the tool in C++
        and OpenGL, which made it all the way to a handsome looking beta version but left me still unsatisfied. As a result of
        some UXP limitations I had to do continuous polling in Photoshop to get the data I needed and that sometimes proved
        to be unreliable and fragile.</p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-medium mb-4 dark:text-neutral-300">The pivot</h2>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">I set out to create a Photoshop plugin but had to realise that if I wanted to hit all my goals
        I had to pivot to a different strategy as Photoshop's plugin ecosystem (both UXP and native) were too limiting.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">The current version is a native C application that uses screen capture to analyze any part of
        the desktop in real time — not just Photoshop. This decouples it from the limitations of the plugin APIs while making
        it usable untethered, with any application.</p>
