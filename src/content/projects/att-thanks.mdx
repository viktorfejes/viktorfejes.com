    <p class="max-w-xl text-lg mb-8">I retouched and helped with the overall direction for the AT&T Thanks campaign. The project called for a range of creative skills, from designing an appealing and fitting color palette, to compositing and retouching the final images. The result was a series of images that were used in various marketing materials, including billboards, social media, and in-store displays.</p>
